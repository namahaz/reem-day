# Reem.day
## My Heart, My Two Eyes,
## The Soul Of My Soulâ€¦

In November, 2023, an unnanounced Israeli airstrike hit the home where Khaleed Nabhan lived with his children and grandchildren. Lying beside their mom, 3 year old Reem Ali Badwan and 5 year old Tariq were trapped under rubble and succumbed to their injuries. Reem's birthday was on December 23rd, a birthday she shared with her beloved grandfather.

### December 23rd marks Reem's Day of Remembrance For Children Of Wars. Please donate to children's aid groups.
