--

Whereas, since October 7th, thousands of children have died from the 2023 Israel-Palestine war; and

Whereas, during conflicts, children should never be collateral damage; and

Whereas, such conflicts have left families and communities with tremendous loss and grief in the aftermath of deaths; and

Whereas, such conflicts have injured and scarred children immensely; and

Whereas, Reem and Tariq were asleep in their beds before an unannounced Israeli airstrike on their residence; and 

Whereas, Khaleed Nabhan tenderly cared for his grandchildren showing us that civilians pay the greatest price of wars; and

Whereas, Khaleed and Reem will never again celebrate their birthday together on December 23rd; and

Resolved: that December 23rd shall be known as Reem Remembrance Day for Children of Wars, yearly in perpetuity; and be it

Further Resolved: that the City and County is committed to recognizing and speaking out against the harming and killing of vulnerable children in wartime.
